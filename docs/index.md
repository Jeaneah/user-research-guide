# User Research Guide

The B.C. User Research Guide provides documentation and instruction on conducting user research in the B.C. Government. This guide is hosted on Github as a way to work in the open and receive feedback on content.

## Get Started
You will need to create a Github account to suggest edits in Github

Each page has a link to "suggest an edit". If you find inaccurate content, you need more information, or something is missing, use this link to create an "issue" in Github repository.

You can also email suggestions to <uxbc@gov.bc.ca>
