The focus of your research determines who you recruit and how many people you recruit. Consider recruiting people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, and life circumstances to capture a wide variety of experiences and perspectives. 

Recruitment takes time and is a key step in user research. Don't rush this process!

# How Many Research Participants Do I Need?

There is no one exact number you need to achieve when completing user research. Qualitative research focuses on the depth and breadth of information collected. Here's how we determine if we've recruited and interviewed enough users.

### Are different types of users represented?

Narrowing down user needs when there are multiple users is hard. However, if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. 

- **Tool experience:** How familiar is the user with how to use the website, application, and/or product/service?
- **Program experience:** How familiar is the user with programs and/or services that surround the tool?
- **Domain experience:** How knowledgeable is the user about this content?

### Have we heard from a diverse set of users?

Is the mix of users you are speaking to a reflection of the diversity one might see in the overall population? This is where GBA+ can help with recruitment. 

- **Accessbility:** Users with special needs are often good at articulating the problems more than generic users might experience, but have a harder time putting their finger on it.
- **Extreme use cases:** Extreme users tend to have the same needs as the average users, but their needs are much more amplified. This is the opposite of the common approach to defining users very broadly. For example, "everyone in BC is my user group."

### Are themes beginning to emerge?

Patterns in user answers typically begin to form after you've interviewed five different people. Again, this is approximate and there no one exact number. We donâ€™t need huge sample sizes to find usable insights.

# Finding the Right Research Participants

Depending on who your target audience is, there will be multiple ways to recruit users. Consider what is most suitable and relevant for your project. 

Recruitment Channels:
- Ministry stakeholders
- Ministry service partners or organizations receiving operating funding from the province
- ServiceBC
- Social media and social networks
- Community groups and non-profit organizations
- Referrals from other users
- Referrals from BC public servants

Intercept Recruitment Locations:
- Public places (libraries, parks, shopping centres, university/college campuses)
- ServiceBC offices
- Ministry service partners

If you ask stakeholders or service partners to help you contact users, give a clear picture of the kinds of participants you are looking for. For example, if your research topic is focused on student loans, you are recruiting participants who are applying for or currently receiving BC student loans.

# Writing Recruitment Messages

Asking stakeholders or community groups to send out your recruitment messaging through their established communication channels is a great way to connect with users who may not typically engage with government. Channels like email newsletters and Facebook pages often yield a large number of user responses.
