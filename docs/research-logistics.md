The focus of your research determines who you recruit and how many people you recruit. Consider recruiting people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, and life circumstances to capture a wide variety of experiences and perspectives. 

Recruitment takes time and is a key step in user research. Don't rush this process!

# How Many Research Participants Do I Need?

There is no one exact number you need to achieve when completing user research. Qualitative research focuses on the depth and breadth of information collected. Here's how we determine if we've recruited and interviewed enough users.

### Are different types of users represented?

Narrowing down user needs when there are multiple users is hard. However, if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. 

- **Tool experience:** How familiar is the user with how to use the website, application, and/or product/service?
- **Program experience:** How familiar is the user with programs and/or services that surround the tool?
- **Domain experience:** How knowledgeable is the user about this content?

### Have we heard from a diverse set of users?

Is the mix of users you are speaking to a reflection of the diversity one might see in the overall population? This is where GBA+ can help with recruitment. 

- **Accessbility:** Users with special needs are often good at articulating the problems more than generic users might experience, but have a harder time putting their finger on it.
- **Extreme use cases:** Extreme users tend to have the same needs as the average users, but their needs are much more amplified. This is the opposite of the common approach to defining users very broadly. For example, "everyone in BC is my user group."

### Are themes beginning to emerge?

Patterns in user answers typically begin to form after you've interviewed five different people. Again, this is approximate and there no one exact number. We don’t need huge sample sizes to find usable insights.

# Finding the Right Research Participants

Depending on who your target audience is, there will be multiple ways to recruit users. Consider what is most suitable and relevant for your project. 

**Recruitment Channels:**
- Ministry stakeholders
- Ministry service partners or organizations receiving operating funding from the province
- ServiceBC
- Social media and social networks
- Community groups and non-profit organizations
- Referrals from other users
- Referrals from BC public servants

**Intercept Recruitment Locations:**
- Public places (libraries, parks, shopping centres, university/college campuses)
- ServiceBC offices
- Ministry service partners

If you ask stakeholders or service partners to help you contact users, give a clear picture of the kinds of participants you are looking for. For example, if your research topic is focused on student loans, you are recruiting participants who are applying for or currently receiving BC student loans.

# Writing Recruitment Messages

A recruitment message is an easy way to quickly describe your research project to potential participants. Depending on where and how the message will be send out, the length and level of detail will vary. 

Asking stakeholders or community groups to send out your recruitment messaging through their established communication channels is a great way to connect with users who may not typically engage with government. Channels like email newsletters and Facebook pages often yield a large number of user responses. 

**Essential elements to include:**
- Brief overview of what the project wants to achieve
- Qualifying user statement or question
- Time commitment/estimated interview length
- Researcher contact information
- Date range when interviews will be scheduled
- Compensation (if applicable) 

### Sample Recruitment Message, Participant

*Are you a parent or guardian of a child with autism spectrum disorder?*

*If so, we are interested in speaking to you about government autism services. The Province is improving how families learn about and use government autism services. We'd like to spend approximately 60 minutes with you to better understand your needs and your challenges when accessing autism information and utilizing funding.*

*What’s in it for you? You’ll receive a $50 gift card as a thank you for your time. We are scheduling interviews for January. If you are interested, please contact jane.doe@gov.bc.ca or call 250-555-1234 by January 4.*

*We will be qualifying participants. Please note, only those selected to participate in the research will be eligible for compensation.*

### Sample Recruitment Message, Stakeholder/Service Provider

*To Whom It May Concern:*

*We are working on a project with the Ministry of Child and Family Development to improve how families, providers, and organizations like yourself learn about and use government autism services. MCFD identified **Service Provider Name** as a key contact for the project because of your connections to families who may have a child diagnosed with ASD, or who are in the process of pursuing a diagnosis.*

*We’re doing research to better understand the needs and challenges that families may encounter when accessing autism information and funding.There are two ways we’re hoping you can help.*

*1. Could we schedule an interview with yourself or one of your colleagues who has experience working with families navigating autism information and services, for us to learn from you about the needs and challenges you see and how you provide services?*

*2. Could you help connect us with families who may be interested in participating in the project? A large part of our work is talking to parents and caregivers across the province about their stories, challenges and successes with autism services in B.C. Sessions will take place in the first three weeks of January. We go to where parents/caregivers are – in their homes, at work, or a place they feel comfortable – and spend about an hour getting to know them and hearing about their experiences. These longer behavioural interviews help our research focus on the entire parent journey. We typically need about an hour with each person, but can accommodate a shorter interview. All parents/caregivers interviewed received a stipend as a thank you for their time.*

*If you have further questions, feel free to give us a call, and please let us know if there is a good time to meet in person. Thank you in advance for your time. Your involvement will help us better understand needs and  identify opportunities to improve autism information and service delivery in B.C.*

# Screening Participants

A screener is a list of criteria used to check whether or not your potential participant would match with the characteristics of your target audience. Screening participants also helps you meet your research requirements. 

It’s fine if the individual is not a strong match. It saves your time and the individual’s time. Thank them for their interest in the project and for sharing their story, and ask if they are open to you contacting them in the future for other research projects.

### Sample Screener

- Your location/community: 
- Family status: 
- Age of child at autism diagnosis:
- Current age of child:
- Availability during the week of January 14: 

# Scheduling Interviews

Once participants have been screened and selected, it is important to keep them informed about their participation in the interview process. When scheduling an interview, be flexible, but firm when picking a date, time and location to meet. 

**For example:**
- "We are scheduling interviews in Victoria on Monday, January 13 and Tuesday, January 14 between 8am and 6pm."
- "We will be in your community next Friday and have availability to meet at 1:30pm or 4pm."
- "We are happy to host you at our meeting space downtown. If you prefer, we could also meet at your home or office."

Whenver possible, use a participant's preferred method of communication (phone call, email, or text) to contact them when the interview date is set. It's also good practice to give them a courtesy reminder a day in advance of the interview.

**A note for researchers.** While it's tempting to schedule as many interviews as possible in one day, we know from experience this isn't good for anyone. 

- **Interviews are tiring.** Interviewing, active listening, observing, and note-taking require a high degree of focus. 

- **Interviews can be emotionally taxing.** Depending on your research topic, users may share highly sensitive and emotional stories. Giving yourself enough time to process and recover is very important. 

We recommend scheduling no more than four one-hour interviews per day. Leave a buffer of at least 45 minutes between interviews.
