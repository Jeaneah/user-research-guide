The focus of your research determines who you recruit and how many people you recruit. Additionally, your recruitment effort should aim to capture a wide net of perspectives on the issue that is the focus of your discovery research. Consider recruiting people of different service branches, ages, ethnicities, genders, and life circumstances so as to capture a breadth of experience and perspectives

# How Many Research Participants Do I Need?

There is no one exact number you need to achieve when completing user research. Qualitative research focuses on the depth and breadth of information collected. Here's how we determine if we've recruited and interviewed enough users.

### Are different types of users represented?

Narrowing down user needs when there are multiple users is hard. However, if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. 

- **Tool experience:** How familiar is the user with how to use the website, application, and/or product/service?
- **Program experience:** How familiar is the user with programs and/or services that surround the tool?
- **Domain experience:** How knowledgeable is the user about this content?

### Have we heard from a diverse set of users?

Is the mix of users you are speaking to a reflection of the diversity one might see in the overall population? This is where GBA+ can help with recruitment. 

- **Accessbility:** Users with special need are often good at articulating the problems more than generic users might experience, but have a harder time putting their finger on it.
- **Extreme use cases:** Extreme users tend to have the same needs as the average users, but their needs are much more amplified. This is the opposite of the common approach to defining users very broadly. For example, "everyone in BC is my user group."
