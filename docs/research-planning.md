# Problem Definition

# Defining the User Need(s)

The better you understand your users, the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them.

Who are our users? They are people who need to use the services you are working on. When designing or iterating a government service, start by learning about current and future users. If you don’t understand who the users are or what they need from your service, you can’t build the right thing.

### User Needs Statements
User need statements, also often called problem statements or point-of-view statements, are important in capturing what we want to achieve with our design, not how. They're used to summarize who a particular user is, the user’s need, and why the need is important to that user. It defines what you want to solve before you move on to generating potential solutions. 

Traditional need statements have 3 components: 1) a user, 2) a need, and 3) a goal. These are then combined following the pattern [A user] needs [need] in order to accomplish [goal].

- For example, [Alieda, a multitasking, tech-savvy mother of 2] needs [to quickly and confidently compare options without leaving her comfort zone] in order to [spend more time doing the things that really matter].

# Bringing the Team Along

Once ministry readiness, project expectations, and communications have been established, resources will need to be assigned to teams. Service design projects are usually made up of three teams:

Core team: 3 to 5 people from the Strategic Design and Transformation Branch (SDTB) and the partnering ministry. This team conducts the service design work.
Working group: A group of individuals with a vested interested in the project. The core team will present plans and findings along the way and request feedback.
Steering committee: Ministry executive and the project or executive sponsor(s).

# Putting it All Together: The Research Plan


The research plan outlines the goals, approach and logistics for research, and should include:

- Research objectives, key questions, and areas of interest
- Project background
- What kind of participants need to be involved, and how to recruit them
- The research approach including methods for research and analysis
- Research reporting plans
- Resources required, including team, time and budget
- A schedule for research activities and locations
- Support materials (if ready at this point in time) such as:
- Interview scripts and workshop outlines
- Recruiting screener to qualify research participants
- The research plan can and should be updated throughout the project, if required. This plan is simply a guide; the team may have to adapt on the fly to accommodate unexpected changes in schedules, participants or direction of the research. 

# How to Write Research Questions
