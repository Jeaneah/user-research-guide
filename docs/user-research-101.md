# Qualitative vs. Quantative 

Quantitative measures are an important part of understanding a problem. Those familiar with quantitative research look for statistical significance. Qualitative research is different. Finding a balance is important. This is especially true when you need to understand why something happens, know where there are unmet needs, establish new services, or optimize existing ones. Quantitative measures are good for telling us what happens. Qualitative methods build on that to explore the why and the how.

Acknowledging the difference between the two research methods is important. For quantitatively-based project partners, discuss with them how usable insights from the qualitative side give colour and human insight to the quantitative data to which they have access. While quantitative data informs service effectiveness quite well, qualitative data leads to services that are easy, effective, and emotionally resonant and can come from any individual. Remember, we donâ€™t need huge sample sizes to find usable insights.
