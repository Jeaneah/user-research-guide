# Securing a Budget

We often hear from ministries that they want to do user research, but don't have room in their budget to make it happen. User research doesn't have to be expensive, but there are some key costs to consider.

## Staff Time
Good research requires a time committment. Expect members of your research team to dedicate at least 50 per cent of their workday to the project. While this may not be an out-of-pocket expense, it may require temporarily shifitng staff responsibilties. Of course, hiring a full-time user research role is always an option. 

- Cost: $0 and up

## Travel
Getting out and talking to people is the heart of user research. The Service Design team likes to meet people where they are; home, work, school, or their favourite coffee shop. We also like to conduct interviews in different regions of the province. A parent accessing child care in Vancouver will have a very different experience compared to a parent in Dawson Creek. 

- Preferred Travel Budget: 
Two team members meeting people in multiple regions of the province (hotel, airfare, car rental, taxi or public transportation, per diems). 
**Example:** Surrey, Kelowna, Prince George, Nanaimo
*Approximately $4,000*

- Low Cost Travel Budget: 
Two team members meeting people in their community and one to two neighbouring communities (mileage costs, taxi or public transportation, per diems). 
**Example:** Victoria, Langford, Duncan
*Approximately $300*

- No Cost Travel Budget:
Two team members meeting people in their community, hosting interviews at government locations when appropriate (taxi or public transportation). 
**Example:** Victoria
*Approximately $0-$50*
