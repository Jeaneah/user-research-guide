# One-on-One Interviews

# Intercepts

# Shadowing

Shadowing and observation is about spending time observing a user in the context of their life at home or at work. Watching someoneâ€™s behaviour can surface new insights beyond what people say in an interview. Observation and shadowing can be followed up with an interview based on what was observed to dig deeper into their behaviour. 

### Steps
- Recruit users like you would for a one-on-one interview. 
- Confirm that they understand that you're going to spend some time shadowing their activities. When shadowing BC Public Service employees, it's important to explain you're not there to judge their work. This is not about job performance!
- Ask the user to show you what they do. Depending on your research topic you may focus on specific activities, or have them carry on a "typical day" for a broader focus. Have your participant explain things as if you know nothing about their work.
- Let the person explain their work over the time that you spend together. Approach an observation session just like an intern or someone new on the job. Ask follow-up questions to clarify, especially points most relevant to your areas of interest.
- Give the user some language in advance to explain to others why you're with them. For exmaple, "Oh, Jim is from the Intranet project and is tagging along with me today to learn more about my work." 
- Wrap up by having them clarify any outstanding questions, or conduct a more formal interview.
